# ASSIGNMENT-2
## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Takes input from the user as an integer.

Uses the modulus operator (%) to check if the number is divisible by 2.

Implements an if-else control structure:

If the number is divisible by 2 (i.e., num % 2 == 0), it is even.

Otherwise, it is odd.

Displays an appropriate message to the user:

Example: "12 is an even number." or "7 is an odd number."


## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50
Initializes a sum variable (total_sum) to 0.

Uses a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 50 (inclusive).

In each iteration:

Adds the current number to the running total (total_sum += num).

After the loop ends, it prints the final result:

Example: "The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275"
